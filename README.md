# Sup! I'm PastelDeFeira! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
I'm a begginer gamedev with experience mostly in Godot. I've published my game [89](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2134360/89/) on Ateam and am currently working on updating it! I started my gamedev journey around 1 year ago, and still have a lot to learn...




## 🛠 Skills/Experience
Mostly basic 2D gamedev in Godot (using GDScript)




## Other info
👩‍💻 Currently working by myself as an indie gamedev

🧠 Going more in depth into Godot

👯‍♀️ Looking to collaborate on basically any Godot-related projects

🤔 Looking for help with going more in depth into non-gamedev related languages

📫 You can contact me through Twitter if you wish (or even by submitting a pr or issue on my /PastelDeFeira repo lmao)

⚡️ Fun fact: I also hold the speedrun world record for Donkey Konga
